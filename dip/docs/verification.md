# Verification and maintainer workflow

## One entry point

[`setup.sh`](../setup.sh) resolves repository paths from its own location, so
it can be invoked from another working directory. From the repository root:

```bash
dip/setup.sh -b
dip/setup.sh -t
dip/setup.sh -g mhd_shock_tube
dip/setup.sh -c mhd_shock_tube
```

`-b` creates an isolated `dip/.venv` and installs the newest `scinumtools3>=0.8.4`,
pytest, and their dependencies from PyPI with pip. It requires package-index
access and does not read or write a local SciNumTools3 source tree. The venv
is ignored by Git. Later invocations use it by default; `PYTHON` explicitly
selects another interpreter. `-b -t` installs and then tests in one invocation.

`-t` runs the complete DIP test suite with pytest. `-g SETUP` generates native files into
`dip/generated/SETUP/`. `-c SETUP` regenerates the same setup and invokes
Arepo's Makefile with that `Config.sh`; build files and the executable go into
the same setup directory. `-g SETUP -c` is also accepted. `-c` requires a
configured `Makefile.systype` or `SYSTYPE` environment variable, as in
[Arepo's build guide](../../documentation/source/running.md). Set
`DIP_OUTPUT_ROOT` to place outputs
elsewhere. Compiling does not run a simulation.

The wrapper expects SciNumTools3 Python bindings with manifest overrides,
custom units, `Environment.select()`, value tags and metadata, and DIPH5
support. After `-b`, the direct test command is:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=dip/src \
  dip/.venv/bin/python -B -m pytest dip/tests
```

## What the tests establish

- [`test_bundled_examples.py`](../tests/test_bundled_examples.py) generates all
  16 setups as separate pytest cases and compares active `Config.sh` and `param.txt` names and values
  directly with the bundled Arepo examples. It ignores comments, whitespace,
  ordering, and equivalent numeric spelling, but compares path strings
  exactly. It also checks softening-family counts against Arepo's native
  default or explicit `NSOFTTYPES`.
- [`test_rendering.py`](../tests/test_rendering.py) checks override loading,
  persistence, tagged export behavior, validation errors, output schedules,
  and native and table rendering after DIPH5 reload. Each full setup runs in
  a separate process because custom unit names are registered process-wide.
- [`test_override_units.py`](../tests/test_override_units.py) checks overrides
  expressed in hours, metres, and centimetres, including changes to a code
  unit base, and rejects incompatible dimensions.
- [`test_setup_script.py`](../tests/test_setup_script.py) checks generation
  from another working directory and that compilation receives the selected
  config and isolated build paths. It uses a stand-in `make` so the test does
  not require an MPI compiler.
- [`table_inventory.json`](../tests/table_inventory.json) tracks the supplied
  numeric datasets. Tests compare rendered values with the upstream tables.

The checks prove source-file equivalence for the bundled examples and the
behavior listed above. Compiling with `-c` additionally checks the selected
configuration against the local compiler and libraries. Running a physical
simulation and checking its science outputs is a separate step.
