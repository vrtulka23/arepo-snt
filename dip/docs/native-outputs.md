# Native output, tables, and provenance

## Tags and typed export policy

The [renderer](../src/arepo_dipl/rendering.py) selects values tagged
`arepo:config` for `Config.sh` and `arepo:param` for `param.txt`. Each exported
node declares its Arepo name with `?native`, so adding a normal scalar
parameter requires a DIPL declaration rather than a Python catalog entry.
True config booleans emit bare flags; false config booleans are omitted.
Runtime booleans emit `0` or `1`.

The optional [`arepo_export` schema](../profiles/schemas/export.dip) provides
typed settings for cases that need extra policy:

| Field | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Include the field when its other conditions pass. |
| `units` | `"native"` | Convert to an explicit output unit when set. |
| `omit_nonpositive` | `false` | Omit a zero or negative number. |
| `requires_enabled` | `[]` | Require all named boolean features to be true. |

For example, [`code_units.length`](../profiles/standard_units.dip) declares
`export.units = "cm"` and `?native "UnitLength_in_cm"`. The
[selected unit-base profile](units-and-expressions.md) similarly exports mass
in grams and velocity in centimetres per second. The
[mesh refinement schema](../profiles/schemas/mesh.dip) exports
`ReferenceGasPartMass` only when `build.mesh.refinement` is enabled. The
[build schema](../profiles/schemas/build.dip) defaults `NSOFTTYPES` export to
off, because this Arepo source uses six families when the flag is absent;
the four setups that explicitly use two families enable its export.

The renderer checks unknown export settings, invalid types, missing native
names, missing or non-boolean dependencies, conversion errors, and duplicate
active native names. It sorts by full DIPL path for reproducible output.
`?requires` is descriptive metadata; `requires_enabled` is the export rule.
Indexed `SofteningComovingTypeN`, `SofteningMaxPhysTypeN`, and
`SofteningTypeOfPartTypeN` are handled by
[`generator.py`](../src/arepo_dipl/generator.py), since Arepo uses flat indexed
names for those families.

## Output schedules and scientific datasets

Five bundled setups use typed [output schedule tables](../examples/cosmological_star_formation/output_schedule.dipt).
Cosmological schedules contain `scale_factor` and `write_flag`; linear-time
schedules contain `time` in `arepo_time` and `write_flag`. The generator writes
the schedule to `output.schedule.filename` when enabled. A matching time
column is required. Generated paths must stay within the output directory
and may not collide. Disabling a schedule does not remove an older schedule
file from a previous generation.

Scientific numeric tables live in `.dipt` files and are registered as named
`sources[]` in each manifest. For example, the
[gravity-only manifest](../examples/cosmological_gravity_only/DIPfile)
registers mass-reference tables; its [tables.dip](../examples/cosmological_gravity_only/tables.dip)
imports them under `datasets` and declares output filenames. The
[table renderer](../src/arepo_dipl/tables.py) uses SciNumTools3's ordered
`inspect_table()` result and emits native text layouts at 17 significant digits.
The order survives DIPH5 loading. There are 15 distinct additional numeric
tables and 16 imports across the setups, plus the five schedules and shared cooling
table. Binary initial conditions and external generator configurations keep
their existing roles.

## DIPH5 snapshot

[`generate()`](../src/arepo_dipl/generator.py) uses the SciNumTools3 adapter
runner to write `Config.sh`, `param.txt`, the selected tables and schedule, and
`environment.diph5`. When regenerating into an existing directory, it stages
fresh outputs before replacing generated files and preserves an existing build.
DIPH5 stores evaluated values, units, custom units, schema metadata, tags, source and
override provenance, collections, and table data. A fresh process can load
the snapshot and render the native files again without the DIPL sources.
The [roundtrip tests](../tests/test_rendering.py) verify that behavior.
